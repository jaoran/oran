        brings a different prospective in life that allow you to look into yourself to understand the
        journey that you are embarking on, to realize that your approach is too passive, and
        you are getting lost in the possibility and the purpose of your journey. It is a unique
        situation because you aware of whom the person is but not aware of whom the person really is
        but the little that is present is powerful and impactful but unawareness of the fact
        of who is crazy, but I guess it is present for who is able to get the privilege to be in
        the space.</div>

        <summary> Blunt  </summary>
        <p> Just like the other fire signs Aries and Leo, Sagittarius doesn't mince words.
            while not intentional sometimes their honesty is off putting themselves in the other person's
            shoes, remembering that their intensity isn't always perceived by others as kindness</p>

        <summary> Impatient </summary>
        <p> Sagittarius want what they want, and they want it now. Their impatience can get in the way of many things.
            This sign needs to learn how to wait; it May be hard, but sometimes the journey is better
            than the destination</p>
