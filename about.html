    <h1> Welcome to My Portfolio </h1>

<div id="container">
        <div id="container_content" > A soft wind stirred the golden fields as I stood at the edge of the road.
            I was young, eager, and full of dreams, staring at the winding path before I. This was my journey—one
            I had long awaited, though I did not yet know where it would lead. With a deep breath, I took my first
            step. The road was smooth at first, the sun warm on my skin, and the world felt open, limitless. Along the
            way, I met others—some who walked beside me for miles, sharing laughter and lessons, and some who only
            passed briefly, leaving behind a word of wisdom or a fleeting smile. As the seasons changed, so did the road.
            What was once an easy path turned rugged and steep. There were days when the rain poured so hard that I
            couldn’t see my next step. I stumbled, lost my way, and at times, questioned why I continued. But in the
            darkest moments, I found hidden strength sometimes in the form of a kind stranger, sometimes in the quiet
            whisper of my own heart telling me to keep going.
